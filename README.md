# odd dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles and some scripts I use in my Arch Linux environment.
Note: Make sure to set your own wallpaper and adjust the keybindings as needed.

I use Hyprland, SDDM, Thunar, Kitty, and Waybar.

This repo includes:
 - A simple stopwatch script I built
 - A system maintenance script created by Fernando Cejas (aka android10)

⚠️ The code is not very clean at the moment — comments are a mix of English and French, and the structure is a bit messy. I'll work on organizing and cleaning it up soon.
