# odd dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles and some scripts I use in my Arch Linux environment.
![demo icon](https://github.com/byodd/dotfiles/blob/main/demo.png?raw=true "Desktop Demo")

Note: Make sure to set your own username and adjust the keybindings as needed (the fr keyboard is set in hyprland.conf).

I use Hyprland, SDDM, Thunar, Kitty, btop, NetworkManager and Waybar.

This repo includes:
 - My hyprland early 2000s inspired theme
 - A simple stopwatch script I built
 - A system maintenance script created by Fernando Cejas (aka [android10](https://github.com/android10))
 - grimblast script for screenshot
⚠️ The code is not very clean at the moment — comments are a mix of English and French, and the structure is a bit messy. I'll work on organizing and cleaning it up soon.
